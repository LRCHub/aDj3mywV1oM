[00:35.06] Took my family away from my Carolina home
[00:39.82] Had dreams about the West and started to roam
[00:44.81] Six long months on a dust-covered trail
[00:49.75] They say heaven's at the end, but so far, it's been hell
[01:17.75] 
[00:53.44] And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
[00:59.28] Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
[01:23.78] 
[01:12.35] We were diggin' and siftin' from five 'til five
[01:17.19] Sellin' everything we found just to stay alive
[01:21.72] Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars
[01:26.48] Sinnin' was the big thing, Lord, and Satan was the star
[01:53.98] 
[01:30.43] And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
[01:36.08] Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
[02:00.58] 
[02:26.15] Dance hall girls were the evenin' treat
[02:30.64] Empty cartridges and blood lines the gutters of the street
[02:35.48] Men were shot down for the sake of fun
[02:39.98] Or just to hear the noise of their forty-four guns
[03:04.98] 
[02:43.65] And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
[02:49.36] Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
[03:13.86] 
[03:02.26] Now my widow, she weeps by my grave
[03:07.05] Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
[03:11.86] Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame
[03:17.02] All for a useless and no-good worthless claim
[03:39.52] 
[03:20.89] And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
[03:26.13] Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
[03:32.15] Fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
[03:36.64] Gold in them hills, and it's waitin' for me there
[04:01.14] 
[03:43.78] Waitin' for me there
